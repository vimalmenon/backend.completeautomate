## Code Quality Checks
**Before committing code, you MUST run the following commands to ensure consistency:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use Make (Recommended - runs all checks)
make check

# Option 2: Run checks individually
make format      # Auto-format code with black
make lint        # Run flake8 linter
make type-check  # Run mypy type checker
make test        # Run all tests

# Option 3: Use Tox (runs in isolated environments)
tox              # Run all checks
tox -p auto      # Run all checks in parallel (faster)
```
- All checks must pass before creating a pull request
- Use `make format` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Use `make help` to see all available commands
- If any issues remain, fix them manually before committing
- Ensure no errors appear in the console output
- Verify all tests pass with green checkmarks

**Quick Reference**:
- `make check` - Run all checks (format, lint, type-check, test)
- `make format` - Auto-format code
- `make format-check` - Check formatting without changes
