# Wiki Schema

## Domain
AI automation platform — backend for Complete Automate. Covers AI/ML techniques (LLMs, LangGraph, prompt engineering), AWS infrastructure (Cognito, DynamoDB, S3), YouTube content generation, and the platform's prompt agent ecosystem.

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `langgraph-pipelines.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]`
  at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source.

## Frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Page Title
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
  tags: [from taxonomy below]
  sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
  confidence: high | medium | low
  contested: true
  contradictions: [other-page-slug]
  ---
  ```

### raw/ Frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  source_url: https://example.com/article
  ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
  sha256: <hex digest of the raw content>
  ---
  ```

## Tag Taxonomy
- **Platform:** backend, api, prompt-agent, langgraph, job-queue
- **Infra:** aws, cognito, dynamodb, s3, deployment
- **AI/ML:** llm, prompt-engineering, rag, agent, embedding
- **Content:** youtube, blog, transcription, summarization
- **Data:** analytics, visualization, pipeline, s3-data
- **Meta:** comparison, tutorial, reference, architecture

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or things outside the domain
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with cross-links
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity. Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report
